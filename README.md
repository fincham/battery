Interrogate `upowerd` over dbus to see what's up with the synthesised composite battery device (DisplayDevice). No promises.

On e.g. Lenovo laptops with multiple batteries this produces a nice one line summary of the status of both batteries as an aggregate.

Would go well with something like `i3blocks` at a slow refresh rate (e.g. 15 seconds).
